# BuyMePizza
 Here's my addreas- will you buy me a pizza? 

I created this app in order to understand the functionality and use of android's:
Permissions (normal and dangerous), 
Fused Location Provider,
Content Provider. 

Here's a typical flow of the app: 
I get the current location of the user.
I display a collection of all their contacts in the context of your app, 
I allow them to send the location to one of the contacts via other apps such as Whatsapp, Gmail, and ask them to buy them a pizza.

Enjoy!
